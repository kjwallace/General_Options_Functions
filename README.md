# General_Options_Functions
Code for options analysis and generalizations about market theory and practice using python.

Useful for observing programmtic implementations of options pricing, processing market data and options theory compared to reality. 

Code adapted from Dr. Yves Hilpisch and mainly constitute my own notes on Derivatives Analytics with Python. 

More notes will be uploaded once formalized and compiled on my end.
